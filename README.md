## Pacman Agents  

This project implements a team of Pacman agents using adaptive offensive and defensive strategies based on scores. The offensive agent collects food and power pellets but switches to a defensive behaviour when winning, while the defensive agent protects our team's side by tracking and intercepting opponents. Both agents use BFS for pathfinding and dynamically adjust their behavior to maximize strategic advantage.  

command used for testing the team against the baseline_team: 
python capture.py -r agents/team_name_1/my_team.py -b baseline_team -l RANDOM
